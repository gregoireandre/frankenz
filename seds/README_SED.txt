- SED files (e.g., S0_A_0.sed) should be in a two-column format [wavelength (angstroms), flux (f_lambda, NOT f_nu)] separated by a space.
- LIST files (e.g. BROWN.list) should be in a three-column format [counter (arbitrary), shorthand name (arbitrary), filename (local path)] separated by a space.

- All LIST and FILTER files should be contained within this (SED/) folder.
